# Multiple conditions are evaluated using AND. That is, they all
# have to be true for the rule to trigger.

# The first condition tests that bins are further than 5 Mb from the
# start and end of each ideogram.  This ensures that the color
# for the first/last bin will be the same as the ideogram.

condition  = var(start) >= 5e6 && var(end) < chrlen(var(chr))-5e6 

# The probability that the second condition is true is proportional to
# the track counter. Bins in inner tracks are more likely to trigger
# this rule.  Here, rand() is a uniformly distributed random number in
# the range [0,1).

condition  = rand() < remap(counter(plot),0,conf(num_plots)-1,1/conf(num_plots),1)

# If this rule is true, the color of the bin is changed to that of a
# random ideogram.
