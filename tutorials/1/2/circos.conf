# 1.2 IDEOGRAM LABELS, TICKS, AND MODULARIZING CONFIGURATION
#
# In this tutorial, I will add tick marks, tick labels and ideogram
# labels to the previous image. This will require the use of a <ticks>
# block and expanding the <ideogram> block. 
#
# To make the configuration more modular, the tick and ideogram
# parameters will be stored in different files and imported using the
# <<include>> directive.

karyotype = data/karyotype/karyotype.human.txt

# The chromosomes_unit value is used as a unit (suffix "u") to shorten
# values in other parts of the configuration file. Some parameters,
# such as ideogram and tick spacing, accept "u" suffixes, so instead of
#
# spacing = 10000000
#
# you can write
#
# spacing = 10u
#
# See ticks.conf for examples.

chromosomes_units = 1000000

# Includes content from ideogram.conf (included file path is relative
# to the file that included it). Conventionally, I separate the 
# contents of the <ideogram> block from circos.conf and include
# it via ideogram.conf.
<<include ideogram.conf>>
 
# Similarly, I put the <ticks> block in ticks.conf
<<include ticks.conf>>
